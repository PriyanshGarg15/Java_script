Return type of variables in JavaScript
1) Primitive Datatypes
Primitive data types are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed once created. There are seven primitive data types in JavaScript:
       Number => number
       String  => string
       Boolean  => boolean
       null  => object
       undefined  =>  undefined
       Symbol  =>  symbol
       BigInt  =>  bigint

2) Non-primitive Datatypes
Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are objects and arrays that can store collections of values and more complex entities. These types are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed. 
  They are also accessed by reference, meaning that the variable holds a reference to the memory location where the data is stored.
       Arrays  =>  object
       Function  =>  function
       Object  =>  object
