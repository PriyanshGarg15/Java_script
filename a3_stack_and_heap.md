In js we have two emory spaces called as heap and stack
In case of primitive datatypes we are alloacted with stack space
whiel in case of non primitive datatype we are alloacated with heap space


jabh bhi stack memeory is used than whatever variable we have declared we get a copy of it

while in heap memory original variabel refernce milta heh i.e any changes will effect the original storage of data
